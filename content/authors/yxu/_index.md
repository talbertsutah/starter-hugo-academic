# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My main focus of research is in probability theory, and within that I mostly study two-dimensional conformally invariant systems. The basic model of these are the Schramm-Loewner Evolution and its variants. I also have interests in statistical mechanics, random walks in random environments, directed polymer models, last passage percolation, and random matrix theory.

I am currently an associate professor in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu/). My research is focused on probability theory.

Prior to being at Utah, I was the Scott Russell Johnson Senior Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, and an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto. I completed my graduate studies at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/) at New York University.
